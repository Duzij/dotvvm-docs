The *Business Pack* `DropDownList` control lets the user select items from a drop down list. The items in a list are created from the `DataSource` collection and can have custom templates. This control does not support searching and the user is not able to add custom values in this control.

The *Business Pack* includes a similar control called [ComboBox](~/controls/businesspack/ComboBox). It is a text field which suggests the user the items to select from. It can perform server search, use custom templates for the suggested items and let the user to add his own values which are not present in the `DataSource` collection.

If you need to select multiple values, you can use the [MultiSelect](~/controls/businesspack/MultiSelect).
