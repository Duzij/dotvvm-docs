## Sample 3: Format Strings

The `FormatString` property specifies the format that will be used to display the number. Use [standard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dwhawy9k(v=vs.110).aspx) or 
[custom](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0c899ak8(v=vs.110).aspx) .NET number format strings.

The exact format of the number is determined from the culture that was used in the HTTP request on the server. You can find more info in the [Globalization](~/pages/concepts/localization-and-cultures/multi-language-applications) tutorial.
