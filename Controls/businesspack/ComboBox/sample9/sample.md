## Sample 9: Customizing Icons

The icons used by the control can be customized using the following inner elements:

* `ToggleIcon` represents an icon that opens the popup with list of available items. The default is `ChevronDown` icon.

* `UnselectIcon` represents an icon that allows the user to deselect the item. The default is `Close` icon.

See the [Icon](~/controls/businesspack/Icon) documentation to find about using other icon packs.
