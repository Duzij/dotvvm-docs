This control is different from the built-in [ComboBox](~/controls/builtin/ComboBox) and is not derived from it.

The *Business Pack* `ComboBox` control is a text field which suggests items to select. It can perform server search, use custom templates for the suggested items and let the user to add his own values which are not present in the `DataSource` collection.

The *Business Pack* includes a similar control called [DropDownList](~/controls/businesspack/DropDownList) which is not a text field and cannot be typed into, however the user can also select items from a list which appears after clicking into the control.

If you need to select multiple values, you can use the [MultiSelect](~/controls/businesspack/MultiSelect).
