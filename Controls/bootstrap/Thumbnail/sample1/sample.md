## Sample 1: Thumbnail

The `Thumbnail` control has the same properties of the displayed image as the [Image](~/controls/bootstrap/Image) control.  

Additionally, it has the `NavigateUrl` property which specifies the URL where the hyperlink navigates to.

The `CaptionTemplate` property of the `Thumbnail` control allows to customize the caption of the thumbnail.
