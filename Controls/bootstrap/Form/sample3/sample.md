## Sample 3: Horizontal Form Label Sizing

If the form is in the **Horizontal** mode, the labels are placed next to the form fields. In this case, you have to specify how wide the 
labels should be. You can use the `LabelSizeXS`, `LabelSizeSM`, `LabelSizeMD`, `LabelSizeLG` and `LabelSizeXL` properties for this purpose.

If you have customized Bootstrap grid system to have different number of columns, use the `NumberOfColumns` property on the [Container](~/controls/bootstrap/Container) control.
