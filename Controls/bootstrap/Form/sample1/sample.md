## Sample 1: Form Controls

The `Form` is an easy to use control which uses the Bootstrap styles to render a form.

The `Type` property specifies the type of the form - _Vertical (default)_, _Inline_ or _Horizontal_.

Each form field is wrapped in the [FormGroup](~/controls/bootstrap/FormGroup) control.
