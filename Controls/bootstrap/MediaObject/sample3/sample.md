## Sample 3: MediaList and Nested MediaObjects

By default, the `MediaObject` renders the `<div>` element, so you can use it independently.

However, if you place the `MediaObject` in the [MediaList](~/controls/bootstrap/MediaList) control, it will be automatically detect this and render as `<li>` element.

The `MediaObject` controls can be nested.
