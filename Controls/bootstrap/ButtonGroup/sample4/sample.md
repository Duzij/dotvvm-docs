## Sample 4: CheckBoxes and RadioButtons in the ButtonGroup

The `ButtonGroup` also supports [CheckBox](~/controls/bootstrap/CheckBox) and [RadioButton](~/controls/bootstrap/RadioButton).

Remember that Bootstrap doesn't support the `Size` and `IsVertical` modifiers when checkboxes or radio buttons are inside the button group.

Also make sure to use the `<bs:CheckBox>` and `<bs:RadioButton>` instead of the `<dot:CheckBox>` and `<dot:RadioButton>` controls. The builtin 
controls are not supported in the `ButtonGroup`.
