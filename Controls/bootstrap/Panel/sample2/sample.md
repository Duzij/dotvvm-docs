## Sample 2: Panel Templates

The Header part of the `Panel` can be customized using the `HeaderTemplate` property.

Similarly, the `FooterTemplate` property allows to customize the footer of the panel. 

If you need to add additional content which should have zero padding, like a [ListGroup](~/controls/bootstrap/ListGroup) 
or [Table](~/controls/bootstrap/Table), use the `AdditionalContentTemplate` property.
