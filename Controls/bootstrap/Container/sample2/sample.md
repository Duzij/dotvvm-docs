## Sample 2: Custom Number of Columns

By default, the Bootstrap has 12 columns in the grid system. However, sometimes it may be wise to modify this value and customize Bootstrap
to have a different number of columns. Because some controls (e.g. [Form](~/controls/bootstrap/Form) have to know the number of columns 
in the grid system, use the `NumberOfColumns` property.
