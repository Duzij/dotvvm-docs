## Sample 1: Basic Accordion

To use this control, just place several `AccordionItem` controls inside the `Accordion` control. The `AccordionItem` inherits from [Card](~/controls/bootstrap4/Card) and can specify the `IsExpanded` property to indicate whether the item is expanded or not.
  
In the most common scenario, you need the first panel to be expanded while the others are collapsed.
