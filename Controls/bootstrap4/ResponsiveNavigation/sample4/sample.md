## Sample 4: DropDownButton and Form Controls in ResponsiveNavigation

Except of the `NavigationItem` controls, you can also use [Form](~/controls/bootstrap4/Form) and [DropDownButton](~/controls/bootstrap4/DropDownButton) controls inside the navigation bar.

You have to place them in the  `LeftAlignedItems` or `RightAlignedItems` elements.

There are some limitations of the Bootstrap navbar. For example, the `Form` control `Type` must be set to `Inline` mode.
