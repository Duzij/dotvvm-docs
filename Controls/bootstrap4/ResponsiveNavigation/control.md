Renders a Bootstrap Navbar widget.

Each menu item in the `ResponsiveNavigation` control is represented by the [NavigationItem](~/controls/bootstrap4/NavigationItem) control. 
You can also use [Form](~/controls/bootstrap4/Form) and [DropDownButton](~/controls/bootstrap4/DropDownButton) controls inside the navigation bar.
