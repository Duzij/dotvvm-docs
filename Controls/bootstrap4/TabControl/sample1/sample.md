## Sample 1: Basic TabControl

Each tab is represented by the [TabItem](~/controls/bootstrap4/TabItem) control.

The header and content of each `TabItem` is defined using the `HeaderTemplate` and `ContentTemplate` properties.  

The `ActiveTabIndex` property specifies a zero-based index of the tab that is currently selected.

A tab item can be disabled by setting its `Enabled` property to `false`.
